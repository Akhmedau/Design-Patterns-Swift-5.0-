Chain Of Responsibility
--------------------------

The chain of responsibility pattern is used to process varied requests, each of which may be dealt with by a different handler.

### Example:

```swift

protocol Withdrawing {
    func withdraw(amount: Int) -> Bool
}

final class MoneyPile: Withdrawing {

    let value: Int
    var quantity: Int
    var next: Withdrawing?

    init(value: Int, quantity: Int, next: Withdrawing?) {
        self.value = value
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.next = next
    }

    func withdraw(amount: Int) -> Bool {

        var amount = amount

        func canTakeSomeBill(want: Int) -> Bool {
            return (want / self.value) > 0
        }

        var quantity = self.quantity

        while canTakeSomeBill(want: amount) {

            if quantity == 0 {
                break
            }

            amount -= self.value
            quantity -= 1
        }

        guard amount > 0 else {
            return true
        }

        if let next = self.next {
            return next.withdraw(amount: amount)
        }

        return false
    }
}

final class ATM: Withdrawing {

    private var hundred: Withdrawing
    private var fifty: Withdrawing
    private var twenty: Withdrawing
    private var ten: Withdrawing

    private var startPile: Withdrawing {
        return self.hundred
    }

    init(hundred: Withdrawing,
           fifty: Withdrawing,
          twenty: Withdrawing,
             ten: Withdrawing) {

        self.hundred = hundred
        self.fifty = fifty
        self.twenty = twenty
        self.ten = ten
    }

    func withdraw(amount: Int) -> Bool {
        return startPile.withdraw(amount: amount)
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
// Create piles of money and link them together 10 < 20 < 50 < 100.**
let ten = MoneyPile(value: 10, quantity: 6, next: nil)
let twenty = MoneyPile(value: 20, quantity: 2, next: ten)
let fifty = MoneyPile(value: 50, quantity: 2, next: twenty)
let hundred = MoneyPile(value: 100, quantity: 1, next: fifty)

// Build ATM.
var atm = ATM(hundred: hundred, fifty: fifty, twenty: twenty, ten: ten)
atm.withdraw(amount: 310) // Cannot because ATM has only 300
atm.withdraw(amount: 100) // Can withdraw - 1x100
```
Command
----------

The command pattern is used to express a request, including the call to be made and all of its required parameters, in a command object. The command may then be executed immediately or held for later use.

### Example:

```swift
protocol DoorCommand {
    func execute() -> String
}

final class OpenCommand: DoorCommand {
    let doors:String

    required init(doors: String) {
        self.doors = doors
    }
    
    func execute() -> String {
        return "Opened \(doors)"
    }
}

final class CloseCommand: DoorCommand {
    let doors:String

    required init(doors: String) {
        self.doors = doors
    }
    
    func execute() -> String {
        return "Closed \(doors)"
    }
}

final class HAL9000DoorsOperations {
    let openCommand: DoorCommand
    let closeCommand: DoorCommand
    
    init(doors: String) {
        self.openCommand = OpenCommand(doors:doors)
        self.closeCommand = CloseCommand(doors:doors)
    }
    
    func close() -> String {
        return closeCommand.execute()
    }
    
    func open() -> String {
        return openCommand.execute()
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```swift
let podBayDoors = "Pod Bay Doors"
let doorModule = HAL9000DoorsOperations(doors:podBayDoors)

doorModule.open()
doorModule.close()
```
Interpreter
--------------

The interpreter pattern is used to evaluate sentences in a language.

### Example

```swift

protocol IntegerExpression {
    func evaluate(_ context: IntegerContext) -> Int
    func replace(character: Character, integerExpression: IntegerExpression) -> IntegerExpression
    func copied() -> IntegerExpression
}

final class IntegerContext {
    private var data: [Character:Int] = [:]

    func lookup(name: Character) -> Int {
        return self.data[name]!
    }

    func assign(expression: IntegerVariableExpression, value: Int) {
        self.data[expression.name] = value
    }
}

final class IntegerVariableExpression: IntegerExpression {
    let name: Character

    init(name: Character) {
        self.name = name
    }

    func evaluate(_ context: IntegerContext) -> Int {
        return context.lookup(name: self.name)
    }

    func replace(character name: Character, integerExpression: IntegerExpression) -> IntegerExpression {
        if name == self.name {
            return integerExpression.copied()
        } else {
            return IntegerVariableExpression(name: self.name)
        }
    }

    func copied() -> IntegerExpression {
        return IntegerVariableExpression(name: self.name)
    }
}

final class AddExpression: IntegerExpression {
    private var operand1: IntegerExpression
    private var operand2: IntegerExpression

    init(op1: IntegerExpression, op2: IntegerExpression) {
        self.operand1 = op1
        self.operand2 = op2
    }

    func evaluate(_ context: IntegerContext) -> Int {
        return self.operand1.evaluate(context) + self.operand2.evaluate(context)
    }

    func replace(character: Character, integerExpression: IntegerExpression) -> IntegerExpression {
        return AddExpression(op1: operand1.replace(character: character, integerExpression: integerExpression),
                             op2: operand2.replace(character: character, integerExpression: integerExpression))
    }

    func copied() -> IntegerExpression {
        return AddExpression(op1: self.operand1, op2: self.operand2)
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
var context = IntegerContext()

var a = IntegerVariableExpression(name: "A")
var b = IntegerVariableExpression(name: "B")
var c = IntegerVariableExpression(name: "C")

var expression = AddExpression(op1: a, op2: AddExpression(op1: b, op2: c)) // a + (b + c)

context.assign(expression: a, value: 2)
context.assign(expression: b, value: 1)
context.assign(expression: c, value: 3)

var result = expression.evaluate(context)
```
Iterator
-----------

The iterator pattern is used to provide a standard interface for traversing a collection of items in an aggregate object without the need to understand its underlying structure.

### Example:

```swift
struct Novella {
    let name: String
}

struct Novellas {
    let novellas: [Novella]
}

struct NovellasIterator: IteratorProtocol {

    private var current = 0
    private let novellas: [Novella]

    init(novellas: [Novella]) {
        self.novellas = novellas
    }

    mutating func next() -> Novella? {
        defer { current += 1 }
        return novellas.count > current ? novellas[current] : nil
    }
}

extension Novellas: Sequence {
    func makeIterator() -> NovellasIterator {
        return NovellasIterator(novellas: novellas)
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let greatNovellas = Novellas(novellas: [Novella(name: "The Mist")] )

for novella in greatNovellas {
    print("I've read: \(novella)")
}
```
Mediator
-----------

The mediator pattern is used to reduce coupling between classes that communicate with each other. Instead of classes communicating directly, and thus requiring knowledge of their implementation, the classes send messages via a mediator object.

### Example

```swift
protocol Receiver {
    associatedtype MessageType
    func receive(message: MessageType)
}

protocol Sender {
    associatedtype MessageType
    associatedtype ReceiverType: Receiver
    
    var recipients: [ReceiverType] { get }
    
    func send(message: MessageType)
}

struct Programmer: Receiver {
    let name: String
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    
    func receive(message: String) {
        print("\(name) received: \(message)")
    }
}

final class MessageMediator: Sender {
    internal var recipients: [Programmer] = []
    
    func add(recipient: Programmer) {
        recipients.append(recipient)
    }
    
    func send(message: String) {
        for recipient in recipients {
            recipient.receive(message: message)
        }
    }
}

```

### Usage

```swift
func spamMonster(message: String, worker: MessageMediator) {
    worker.send(message: message)
}

let messagesMediator = MessageMediator()

let user0 = Programmer(name: "Linus Torvalds")
let user1 = Programmer(name: "Avadis 'Avie' Tevanian")
messagesMediator.add(recipient: user0)
messagesMediator.add(recipient: user1)

spamMonster(message: "I'd Like to Add you to My Professional Network", worker: messagesMediator)

```
Memento
----------

The memento pattern is used to capture the current state of an object and store it in such a manner that it can be restored at a later time without breaking the rules of encapsulation.

### Example

```swift
typealias Memento = [String: String]
```

Originator

```swift
protocol MementoConvertible {
    var memento: Memento { get }
    init?(memento: Memento)
}

struct GameState: MementoConvertible {

    private enum Keys {
        static let chapter = "com.valve.halflife.chapter"
        static let weapon = "com.valve.halflife.weapon"
    }

    var chapter: String
    var weapon: String

    init(chapter: String, weapon: String) {
        self.chapter = chapter
        self.weapon = weapon
    }

    init?(memento: Memento) {
        guard let mementoChapter = memento[Keys.chapter],
              let mementoWeapon = memento[Keys.weapon] else {
            return nil
        }

        chapter = mementoChapter
        weapon = mementoWeapon
    }

    var memento: Memento {
        return [ Keys.chapter: chapter, Keys.weapon: weapon ]
    }
}
```

Caretaker

```swift
enum CheckPoint {

    private static let defaults = UserDefaults.standard

    static func save(_ state: MementoConvertible, saveName: String) {
        defaults.set(state.memento, forKey: saveName)
        defaults.synchronize()
    }

    static func restore(saveName: String) -> Any? {
        return defaults.object(forKey: saveName)
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
var gameState = GameState(chapter: "Black Mesa Inbound", weapon: "Crowbar")

gameState.chapter = "Anomalous Materials"
gameState.weapon = "Glock 17"
CheckPoint.save(gameState, saveName: "gameState1")

gameState.chapter = "Unforeseen Consequences"
gameState.weapon = "MP5"
CheckPoint.save(gameState, saveName: "gameState2")

gameState.chapter = "Office Complex"
gameState.weapon = "Crossbow"
CheckPoint.save(gameState, saveName: "gameState3")

if let memento = CheckPoint.restore(saveName: "gameState1") as? Memento {
    let finalState = GameState(memento: memento)
    dump(finalState)
}
```
Observer
-----------

The observer pattern is used to allow an object to publish changes to its state.
Other objects subscribe to be immediately notified of any changes.

### Example

```swift
protocol PropertyObserver : class {
    func willChange(propertyName: String, newPropertyValue: Any?)
    func didChange(propertyName: String, oldPropertyValue: Any?)
}

final class TestChambers {

    weak var observer:PropertyObserver?

    private let testChamberNumberName = "testChamberNumber"

    var testChamberNumber: Int = 0 {
        willSet(newValue) {
            observer?.willChange(propertyName: testChamberNumberName, newPropertyValue: newValue)
        }
        didSet {
            observer?.didChange(propertyName: testChamberNumberName, oldPropertyValue: oldValue)
        }
    }
}

final class Observer : PropertyObserver {
    func willChange(propertyName: String, newPropertyValue: Any?) {
        if newPropertyValue as? Int == 1 {
            print("Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret.")
        }
    }

    func didChange(propertyName: String, oldPropertyValue: Any?) {
        if oldPropertyValue as? Int == 0 {
            print("Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me.")
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
var observerInstance = Observer()
var testChambers = TestChambers()
testChambers.observer = observerInstance
testChambers.testChamberNumber += 1
```
State
---------

The state pattern is used to alter the behaviour of an object as its internal state changes.
The pattern allows the class for an object to apparently change at run-time.

### Example

```swift
final class Context {
	private var state: State = UnauthorizedState()

    var isAuthorized: Bool {
        get { return state.isAuthorized(context: self) }
    }

    var userId: String? {
        get { return state.userId(context: self) }
    }

	func changeStateToAuthorized(userId: String) {
		state = AuthorizedState(userId: userId)
	}

	func changeStateToUnauthorized() {
		state = UnauthorizedState()
	}
}

protocol State {
	func isAuthorized(context: Context) -> Bool
	func userId(context: Context) -> String?
}

class UnauthorizedState: State {
	func isAuthorized(context: Context) -> Bool { return false }

	func userId(context: Context) -> String? { return nil }
}

class AuthorizedState: State {
	let userId: String

	init(userId: String) { self.userId = userId }

	func isAuthorized(context: Context) -> Bool { return true }

	func userId(context: Context) -> String? { return userId }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let userContext = Context()
(userContext.isAuthorized, userContext.userId)
userContext.changeStateToAuthorized(userId: "admin")
(userContext.isAuthorized, userContext.userId) // now logged in as "admin"
userContext.changeStateToUnauthorized()
(userContext.isAuthorized, userContext.userId)
```
Strategy
-----------

The strategy pattern is used to create an interchangeable family of algorithms from which the required process is chosen at run-time.

### Example

```swift

struct TestSubject {
    let pupilDiameter: Double
    let blushResponse: Double
    let isOrganic: Bool
}

protocol RealnessTesting: AnyObject {
    func testRealness(_ testSubject: TestSubject) -> Bool
}

final class VoightKampffTest: RealnessTesting {
    func testRealness(_ testSubject: TestSubject) -> Bool {
        return testSubject.pupilDiameter < 30.0 || testSubject.blushResponse == 0.0
    }
}

final class GeneticTest: RealnessTesting {
    func testRealness(_ testSubject: TestSubject) -> Bool {
        return testSubject.isOrganic
    }
}

final class BladeRunner {
    private let strategy: RealnessTesting

    init(test: RealnessTesting) {
        self.strategy = test
    }

    func testIfAndroid(_ testSubject: TestSubject) -> Bool {
        return !strategy.testRealness(testSubject)
    }
}

```

 ### Usage
 
```swift

let rachel = TestSubject(pupilDiameter: 30.2,
                         blushResponse: 0.3,
                         isOrganic: false)

// Deckard is using a traditional test
let deckard = BladeRunner(test: VoightKampffTest())
let isRachelAndroid = deckard.testIfAndroid(rachel)

// Gaff is using a very precise method
let gaff = BladeRunner(test: GeneticTest())
let isDeckardAndroid = gaff.testIfAndroid(rachel)
```
Template Method
-----------

 The template method pattern defines the steps of an algorithm and allows the redefinition of one or more of these steps. In this way, the template method protects the algorithm, the order of execution and provides abstract methods that can be implemented by concrete types.

### Example

```swift
protocol Garden {
    func prepareSoil()
    func plantSeeds()
    func waterPlants()
    func prepareGarden()
}

extension Garden {

    func prepareGarden() {
        prepareSoil()
        plantSeeds()
        waterPlants()
    }
}

final class RoseGarden: Garden {

    func prepare() {
        prepareGarden()
    }

    func prepareSoil() {
        print ("prepare soil for rose garden")
    }

    func plantSeeds() {
        print ("plant seeds for rose garden")
    }

    func waterPlants() {
       print ("water the rose garden")
    }
}

```

### Usage

```swift

let roseGarden = RoseGarden()
roseGarden.prepare()
```
Visitor
----------

The visitor pattern is used to separate a relatively complex set of structured data classes from the functionality that may be performed upon the data that they hold.

### Example

```swift
protocol PlanetVisitor {
	func visit(planet: PlanetAlderaan)
	func visit(planet: PlanetCoruscant)
	func visit(planet: PlanetTatooine)
    func visit(planet: MoonJedha)
}

protocol Planet {
	func accept(visitor: PlanetVisitor)
}

final class MoonJedha: Planet {
    func accept(visitor: PlanetVisitor) { visitor.visit(planet: self) }
}

final class PlanetAlderaan: Planet {
    func accept(visitor: PlanetVisitor) { visitor.visit(planet: self) }
}

final class PlanetCoruscant: Planet {
	func accept(visitor: PlanetVisitor) { visitor.visit(planet: self) }
}

final class PlanetTatooine: Planet {
	func accept(visitor: PlanetVisitor) { visitor.visit(planet: self) }
}

final class NameVisitor: PlanetVisitor {
	var name = ""

	func visit(planet: PlanetAlderaan)  { name = "Alderaan" }
	func visit(planet: PlanetCoruscant) { name = "Coruscant" }
	func visit(planet: PlanetTatooine)  { name = "Tatooine" }
    func visit(planet: MoonJedha)     	{ name = "Jedha" }
}

```

### Usage

```swift
let planets: [Planet] = [PlanetAlderaan(), PlanetCoruscant(), PlanetTatooine(), MoonJedha()]

let names = planets.map { (planet: Planet) -> String in
	let visitor = NameVisitor()
    planet.accept(visitor: visitor)

    return visitor.name
}

names
```


Creational
==========

> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

Abstract Factory
-------------------

The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with a set of related or dependant objects. 
The "family" of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time.

### Example

Protocols

```swift

protocol BurgerDescribing {
    var ingredients: [String] { get }
}

struct CheeseBurger: BurgerDescribing {
    let ingredients: [String]
}

protocol BurgerMaking {
    func make() -> BurgerDescribing
}

// Number implementations with factory methods

final class BigKahunaBurger: BurgerMaking {
    func make() -> BurgerDescribing {
        return CheeseBurger(ingredients: ["Cheese", "Burger", "Lettuce", "Tomato"])
    }
}

final class JackInTheBox: BurgerMaking {
    func make() -> BurgerDescribing {
        return CheeseBurger(ingredients: ["Cheese", "Burger", "Tomato", "Onions"])
    }
}

```

Abstract factory

```swift

enum BurgerFactoryType: BurgerMaking {

    case bigKahuna
    case jackInTheBox

    func make() -> BurgerDescribing {
        switch self {
        case .bigKahuna:
            return BigKahunaBurger().make()
        case .jackInTheBox:
            return JackInTheBox().make()
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let bigKahuna = BurgerFactoryType.bigKahuna.make()
let jackInTheBox = BurgerFactoryType.jackInTheBox.make()
```
Builder
----------

The builder pattern is used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. 
An external class controls the construction algorithm.

### Example

```swift
final class DeathStarBuilder {

    var x: Double?
    var y: Double?
    var z: Double?

    typealias BuilderClosure = (DeathStarBuilder) -> ()

    init(buildClosure: BuilderClosure) {
        buildClosure(self)
    }
}

struct DeathStar : CustomStringConvertible {

    let x: Double
    let y: Double
    let z: Double

    init?(builder: DeathStarBuilder) {

        if let x = builder.x, let y = builder.y, let z = builder.z {
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
            self.z = z
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }

    var description:String {
        return "Death Star at (x:\(x) y:\(y) z:\(z))"
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let empire = DeathStarBuilder { builder in
    builder.x = 0.1
    builder.y = 0.2
    builder.z = 0.3
}

let deathStar = DeathStar(builder:empire)
```
Factory Method
-----------------

The factory pattern is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.

### Example

```swift
protocol CurrencyDescribing {
    var symbol: String { get }
    var code: String { get }
}

final class Euro: CurrencyDescribing {
    var symbol: String {
        return "â¬"
    }
    
    var code: String {
        return "EUR"
    }
}

final class UnitedStatesDolar: CurrencyDescribing {
    var symbol: String {
        return "$"
    }
    
    var code: String {
        return "USD"
    }
}

enum Country {
    case unitedStates
    case spain
    case uk
    case greece
}

enum CurrencyFactory {
    static func currency(for country: Country) -> CurrencyDescribing? {

        switch country {
            case .spain, .greece:
                return Euro()
            case .unitedStates:
                return UnitedStatesDolar()
            default:
                return nil
        }
        
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let noCurrencyCode = "No Currency Code Available"

CurrencyFactory.currency(for: .greece)?.code ?? noCurrencyCode
CurrencyFactory.currency(for: .spain)?.code ?? noCurrencyCode
CurrencyFactory.currency(for: .unitedStates)?.code ?? noCurrencyCode
CurrencyFactory.currency(for: .uk)?.code ?? noCurrencyCode
```
Monostate
 ------------

 The monostate pattern is another way to achieve singularity. It works through a completely different mechanism, it enforces the behavior of singularity without imposing structural constraints. 
 So in that case, monostate saves the state as static instead of the entire instance as a singleton.
 [SINGLETON and MONOSTATE - Robert C. Martin](http://staff.cs.utu.fi/~jounsmed/doos_06/material/SingletonAndMonostate.pdf)

### Example:

```swift
class Settings {

    enum Theme {
        case `default`
        case old
        case new
    }

    private static var theme: Theme?

    var currentTheme: Theme {
        get { Settings.theme ?? .default }
        set(newTheme) { Settings.theme = newTheme }
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```swift

import SwiftUI

// When change the theme
let settings = Settings() // Starts using theme .old
settings.currentTheme = .new // Change theme to .new

// On screen 1
let screenColor: Color = Settings().currentTheme == .old ? .gray : .white

// On screen 2
let screenTitle: String = Settings().currentTheme == .old ? "Itunes Connect" : "App Store Connect"
```
Prototype
------------

The prototype pattern is used to instantiate a new object by copying all of the properties of an existing object, creating an independent clone. 
This practise is particularly useful when the construction of a new object is inefficient.

### Example

```swift
class MoonWorker {

    let name: String
    var health: Int = 100

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }

    func clone() -> MoonWorker {
        return MoonWorker(name: name)
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let prototype = MoonWorker(name: "Sam Bell")

var bell1 = prototype.clone()
bell1.health = 12

var bell2 = prototype.clone()
bell2.health = 23

var bell3 = prototype.clone()
bell3.health = 0
```

 Singleton
------------

The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.
All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.
There are very few applications, do not overuse this pattern!

### Example:

```swift
final class ElonMusk {

    static let shared = ElonMusk()

    private init() {
        // Private initialization to ensure just one instance is created.
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```swift
let elon = ElonMusk.shared // There is only one Elon Musk folks.
```


Structural
==========

>In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

 Adapter
----------

The adapter pattern is used to provide a link between two otherwise incompatible types by wrapping the "adaptee" with a class that supports the interface required by the client.

### Example

```swift
protocol NewDeathStarSuperLaserAiming {
    var angleV: Double { get }
    var angleH: Double { get }
}
```

**Adaptee**

```swift
struct OldDeathStarSuperlaserTarget {
    let angleHorizontal: Float
    let angleVertical: Float

    init(angleHorizontal: Float, angleVertical: Float) {
        self.angleHorizontal = angleHorizontal
        self.angleVertical = angleVertical
    }
}
```

**Adapter**

```swift
struct NewDeathStarSuperlaserTarget: NewDeathStarSuperLaserAiming {

    private let target: OldDeathStarSuperlaserTarget

    var angleV: Double {
        return Double(target.angleVertical)
    }

    var angleH: Double {
        return Double(target.angleHorizontal)
    }

    init(_ target: OldDeathStarSuperlaserTarget) {
        self.target = target
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let target = OldDeathStarSuperlaserTarget(angleHorizontal: 14.0, angleVertical: 12.0)
let newFormat = NewDeathStarSuperlaserTarget(target)

newFormat.angleH
newFormat.angleV
```

 Bridge
----------

The bridge pattern is used to separate the abstract elements of a class from the implementation details, providing the means to replace the implementation details without modifying the abstraction.

### Example

```swift
protocol Switch {
    var appliance: Appliance { get set }
    func turnOn()
}

protocol Appliance {
    func run()
}

final class RemoteControl: Switch {
    var appliance: Appliance

    func turnOn() {
        self.appliance.run()
    }
    
    init(appliance: Appliance) {
        self.appliance = appliance
    }
}

final class TV: Appliance {
    func run() {
        print("tv turned on");
    }
}

final class VacuumCleaner: Appliance {
    func run() {
        print("vacuum cleaner turned on")
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let tvRemoteControl = RemoteControl(appliance: TV())
tvRemoteControl.turnOn()

let fancyVacuumCleanerRemoteControl = RemoteControl(appliance: VacuumCleaner())
fancyVacuumCleanerRemoteControl.turnOn()
```

 Composite
-------------

The composite pattern is used to create hierarchical, recursive tree structures of related objects where any element of the structure may be accessed and utilised in a standard manner.

### Example

Component

```swift
protocol Shape {
    func draw(fillColor: String)
}
```

Leafs

```swift
final class Square: Shape {
    func draw(fillColor: String) {
        print("Drawing a Square with color \(fillColor)")
    }
}

final class Circle: Shape {
    func draw(fillColor: String) {
        print("Drawing a circle with color \(fillColor)")
    }
}

```

Composite

```swift
final class Whiteboard: Shape {

    private lazy var shapes = [Shape]()

    init(_ shapes: Shape...) {
        self.shapes = shapes
    }

    func draw(fillColor: String) {
        for shape in self.shapes {
            shape.draw(fillColor: fillColor)
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```swift
var whiteboard = Whiteboard(Circle(), Square())
whiteboard.draw(fillColor: "Red")
```

 Decorator
------------

The decorator pattern is used to extend or alter the functionality of objects at run- time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class. 
This provides a flexible alternative to using inheritance to modify behaviour.

### Example

```swift
protocol CostHaving {
    var cost: Double { get }
}

protocol IngredientsHaving {
    var ingredients: [String] { get }
}

typealias BeverageDataHaving = CostHaving & IngredientsHaving

struct SimpleCoffee: BeverageDataHaving {
    let cost: Double = 1.0
    let ingredients = ["Water", "Coffee"]
}

protocol BeverageHaving: BeverageDataHaving {
    var beverage: BeverageDataHaving { get }
}

struct Milk: BeverageHaving {

    let beverage: BeverageDataHaving

    var cost: Double {
        return beverage.cost + 0.5
    }

    var ingredients: [String] {
        return beverage.ingredients + ["Milk"]
    }
}

struct WhipCoffee: BeverageHaving {

    let beverage: BeverageDataHaving

    var cost: Double {
        return beverage.cost + 0.5
    }

    var ingredients: [String] {
        return beverage.ingredients + ["Whip"]
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```swift
var someCoffee: BeverageDataHaving = SimpleCoffee()
print("Cost: \(someCoffee.cost); Ingredients: \(someCoffee.ingredients)")
someCoffee = Milk(beverage: someCoffee)
print("Cost: \(someCoffee.cost); Ingredients: \(someCoffee.ingredients)")
someCoffee = WhipCoffee(beverage: someCoffee)
print("Cost: \(someCoffee.cost); Ingredients: \(someCoffee.ingredients)")
```

 FaÃ§ade
---------

The facade pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.

### Example

```swift
final class Defaults {

    private let defaults: UserDefaults

    init(defaults: UserDefaults = .standard) {
        self.defaults = defaults
    }

    subscript(key: String) -> String? {
        get {
            return defaults.string(forKey: key)
        }

        set {
            defaults.set(newValue, forKey: key)
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let storage = Defaults()

// Store
storage["Bishop"] = "Disconnect me. Iâd rather be nothing"

// Read
storage["Bishop"]
```

##  Flyweight
The flyweight pattern is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with other similar objects.
### Example

```swift
// Instances of SpecialityCoffee will be the Flyweights
struct SpecialityCoffee {
    let origin: String
}

protocol CoffeeSearching {
    func search(origin: String) -> SpecialityCoffee?
}

// Menu acts as a factory and cache for SpecialityCoffee flyweight objects
final class Menu: CoffeeSearching {

    private var coffeeAvailable: [String: SpecialityCoffee] = [:]

    func search(origin: String) -> SpecialityCoffee? {
        if coffeeAvailable.index(forKey: origin) == nil {
            coffeeAvailable[origin] = SpecialityCoffee(origin: origin)
        }

        return coffeeAvailable[origin]
    }
}

final class CoffeeShop {
    private var orders: [Int: SpecialityCoffee] = [:]
    private let menu: CoffeeSearching

    init(menu: CoffeeSearching) {
        self.menu = menu
    }

    func takeOrder(origin: String, table: Int) {
        orders[table] = menu.search(origin: origin)
    }

    func serve() {
        for (table, origin) in orders {
            print("Serving \(origin) to table \(table)")
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let coffeeShop = CoffeeShop(menu: Menu())

coffeeShop.takeOrder(origin: "Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia", table: 1)
coffeeShop.takeOrder(origin: "Buziraguhindwa, Burundi", table: 3)

coffeeShop.serve()
```

 Protection Proxy
------------------

The proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder object, which references an underlying object. 
Protection proxy is restricting access.

### Example

```swift
protocol DoorOpening {
    func open(doors: String) -> String
}

final class HAL9000: DoorOpening {
    func open(doors: String) -> String {
        return ("HAL9000: Affirmative, Dave. I read you. Opened \(doors).")
    }
}

final class CurrentComputer: DoorOpening {
    private var computer: HAL9000!

    func authenticate(password: String) -> Bool {

        guard password == "pass" else {
            return false
        }

        computer = HAL9000()

        return true
    }

    func open(doors: String) -> String {

        guard computer != nil else {
            return "Access Denied. I'm afraid I can't do that."
        }

        return computer.open(doors: doors)
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let computer = CurrentComputer()
let podBay = "Pod Bay Doors"

computer.open(doors: podBay)

computer.authenticate(password: "pass")
computer.open(doors: podBay)
```

 Virtual Proxy
----------------

The proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder object, which references an underlying object.
Virtual proxy is used for loading object on demand.

### Example

```swift
protocol HEVSuitMedicalAid {
    func administerMorphine() -> String
}

final class HEVSuit: HEVSuitMedicalAid {
    func administerMorphine() -> String {
        return "Morphine administered."
    }
}

final class HEVSuitHumanInterface: HEVSuitMedicalAid {

    lazy private var physicalSuit: HEVSuit = HEVSuit()

    func administerMorphine() -> String {
        return physicalSuit.administerMorphine()
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift
let humanInterface = HEVSuitHumanInterface()
humanInterface.administerMorphine()
```
# Top 10 Architecture Characteristics / Non-Functional Requirements with Cheatsheet

Imagine you are buying a car. What essential features do you need in it? A vehicle should deliver a person from point A to point B. But what we also check in it is Safety, Comfort, Maintainability, Ease of repair or Better mileage. You may also look for an electric version or better speed. Why? To limit the surprises which may occur in delivering the primary function, i.e., take a person from Point A to Point B.
Similarly, just like a car, motorcycle, or House, the software has its non-functional requirements called âArchitectural Characteristicsâ. Be it a website, a mobile or a desktop app; it should have a set of quality attributes to meet end-user needs.
Architecture Characteristics / Non-Functional Requirements
Briefly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do, like in the case of a car, take a person from A to B, and non-functional requirements stipulate how a system is supposed to be.
Here is the overall cheatsheet of NFR:
![alt text]([figures/img.png](<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/HzPp8s0"  ><a href="//imgur.com/a/HzPp8s0">Top 10 Architecture Characteristics / Non-Functional Requirements with Cheatsheet</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>))
These top 10 Architectural Characteristics covers most of the aspect of a large-scale project. You donât need to accommodate all in your project; pick the most essential and knock it out. This article is not providing the solution to these NFRs but instead makes you aware of which areas you need to consider when designing a system.
Letâs understand each one of them:
## Scalability:
The ability for the system to perform and operate as the number of users or requests increases. Scalability is achievable with Horizontal or vertical scaling of the machine or simply attaching AutoScalingGroup.
### Traffic Pattern: Understand the traffic pattern of the system. Itâs not cost-efficient to spawn as many machines as possible, even if it is underutilisation.
-- Diurnal Pattern: Traffic increases in the morning and decreases in the evening for a particular region.
-- Global / Regional: Regional Heavy usage of the application.
-- Thundering Herd: Many users are requesting resources, but only a few machines are available to serve the burst of traffic. These could occur during peak time or in densely populated areas.
- Elasticity: Ability to quickly spawn a few machines to handle the burst of traffic and gracefully shrink when the demand is reducing.
- Latency: Ability to serve the request as quickly as possible. This also includes optimising the algorithms and replicating the system near users to reduce the round trip of a request. An average google search takes 400 ms.
Availability
It is measured as a percentage of uptime and defines the proportion of time that a system is functional and working. Availability is affected by system errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks and system load.
Deployment Stamps: Deploy multiple independent copies of application components, including data stores
Geodes: Deploy backend services into a set of geographical nodes, each of which can service any client request in any region.
## Extensibility
Extensibility measures the ability to extend a system and the effort required to implement the extension. The extension can be through adding new functionality or modifying existing functionality. The principle provides for enhancements without impairing current system functions.
- Modular / Reusability: Reusability, together with extensibility, allows technology to be transferred to another project with less development and maintenance time, as well as enhanced reliability and consistency.
- Pluggability: Ability to easily plug other components like in the case of microkernel architecture.
## Consistency
Consistency guarantees that every read returns the most recent write. This means that after the execution of every operation, the data is consistent across all the nodes, and thus all clients see the same data at the same time, no matter which node they connect to. Consistency improves the data freshness.
## Resiliency
A system can gracefully handle and recover from accidental and malicious failures. Detecting failures and recovering quickly and efficiently is necessary to maintain resiliency.
- Recoverability: The preparatory processes and functionality enable you to return your services to an initial functioning state after an unintended change. Unintended changes include the soft or hard deletion or misconfiguration of applications.
-- Disaster Recovery: Disaster recovery (DR) consists of best practices designed to prevent or minimise data loss and business disruption resulting from catastrophic events â everything from equipment failures and localised power outages to cyberattacks, civil emergencies, criminal or military attacks, and natural disasters.
### Design Patterns:
-- Bulkhead: Isolate elements of an application into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function.
-- Circuit Breaker: Handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to fix when connecting to a remote service or resource.
-- Leader Election: Coordinate the actions performed by a collection of collaborating task instances in a distributed application by electing one instance as the leader that assumes responsibility for managing the other instances.
## Usability
Usability can be described as the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience. It is the degree to which specified consumers can use software to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a quantified context of use.
### Accessibility: Make the software available to people with the broadest range of characteristics and capabilities. This includes users with deaf, blind, colourblindness, etc.
### Learnability: How easy users can learn how to use the software?
### API Contract: For Internal teams, understanding the API Contracts can help easily pluggable into any system.
## Observability
Observability is the ability to collect data about program execution, internal states of modules, and communication between components. To improve observability, use various logging and tracing techniques and tools.
### Logging: There are different types of logs generated within each request: event logs, transaction logs, message logs and server logs.
### Alerts & Monitoring: Prepare monitoring dashboards, create SLI (Service Level Indicators) and set up critical alerts.
### L1 / L2 / L3: Setup on-call support process for L1 / L2. L1 support includes interacting with customers. L2 support manages the tickets routed to them by L1 and helps troubleshoot. L3 is the last line of support and usually comprises a development team which addresses the technical issues.
## Security
Degree the software protects information and data so that people or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorisation. This family of characteristics includes confidentiality (data is accessible only to those authorised to have access), integrity (the software prevents unauthorised access to or modification of software or information), nonrepudiation (can actions or events be proven to have taken place), accountability (can user actions of a user be traced), and authenticity (verifying the identity of a user).
### Auditability: Audit trails track system activity so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.
## Legality:
-- Compliance: Adhere to data protection laws like GDPR, CCPA, SOC2, PIPL or FedRamp.
-- Privacy: Ability to hide transactions from internal company employees (encrypted transactions so even DBAs and network architects cannot see them).
Authentication: Security requirements to ensure users are who they say they are.
Authorisation: Security requirements to ensure users can access only certain functions within the application (by use case, subsystem, webpage, business rule, field level, etc.).
### Durability
Durability is the solution ability of softwareâs serviceability and meet usersâ needs for a relatively long time.
Replication: involves sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant resources to improve reliability, fault-tolerance, or accessibility.
Fault Tolerance: It is the property that enables a system to continue operating correctly in the event of the failure of one or more faults within some of its components.
Archivability: Will the data need to be archived or deleted after some time? (For example, customer accounts will be deleted after three months or marked as obsolete and archived in a secondary database for future access.)
### Agility
It has become todayâs buzzword when describing a contemporary software method. An associate agile team could be a handy team able to befitting reply to changes. Modification is what software development is highly abundant.
Maintainability: How easy it is to apply changes and enhance the system? â Represents the degree of effectiveness and efficiency to which developers can modify the software to improve it, correct it, or adapt it to changes in environment and requirements.
-- Testability: how easily developers and others can test the software
-- Ease of development: the degree to which developers can modify the software without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality
### Deployability: The time to get code into production after committing the deployment time.
-- Installability: Ease of system installation on all necessary platforms.
-- Upgradeability: Ability to easily/quickly upgrade from a previous version of this application/solution to a newer version on servers and clients.
-- Portability: Does the system need to run on more than one platform? (For example, does the frontend need to run against Oracle and SAP DB?
### Configurability: The end users can easily change aspects of the softwareâs configuration (through usable interfaces).
-- Compatibility: Degree to which a product, system, or component can exchange information with other products, designs, or members and perform its required functions while sharing the same hardware or software environment.
